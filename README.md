Bikelog
=======

**Bikelog** runs on Ruby 1.9 and is a Ruby on Rails 3 application to manage
the GPS track logs of your bike rides.  As it is still in the early development
phase, a lot of (advanced) features are missing, but the basic functionality
is already implemented.


Features
--------

* Google Maps displaying your tracks
* Statistics (distance, duration, average speeds, ascent etc.)
* Graphical representation of your 12-month activity by distance and duration
* Elevation profiles
* GPX import and export

Todo
----

* Filtering of inaccurate trackpoints for better statistics
* GPS import and export (Garmin provides a JavaScript API)
* KML import (?)
* Split GPX parsing and analyzing into a separate file/library
